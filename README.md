# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

This project is a responsive **Admin Dashboard** built with **React** and **Vite**, featuring a dark and light mode toggle, user management functionalities, and persistent state using `localStorage`.

## Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Users**:
  Manage users with fields like name, role, date, permissions, and status.
  
- **Dynamic Theme Toggle**:
  Switch between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**, with the selected theme persisting across page reloads.

- **LocalStorage Integration**:
  - Newly added or edited users are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage.
  - Previously saved users and the selected theme are loaded on refresh.

## Technologies Used
- **React** for UI development
- **Vite** for a fast build tool and development server
- **Material-UI** for UI components and styling
- **CSS** for custom styling
- **LocalStorage** for data persistence

### CSS Highlights
- **Themed Styles**:
  - `.light-theme` and `.dark-theme` classes for global theme-based styles.
  - Separate styling for headers, tables, buttons, and status indicators in both themes.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Styled components adapt for better usability across devices.
